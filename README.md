<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repository contains a comprehensive CQRS implementation for a distributed environment. The code demonstrates a polyglot microservices application that implements Command Query Responsibility Segregation using Event Sourcing.
CQRS Plus uses a variety of technologies.

#### CQRS
- **What is CQRS?**
  - CQRS separates read (queries) and write (commands) operations, enabling independent scaling and optimization.
  - It recognizes that reading and writing data have different requirements and can benefit from separate implementations.

#### Event Sourcing

- **Understanding Event Sourcing**
  - Event Sourcing captures state changes as a sequence of events over time.
  - Instead of directly modifying state, events representing changes are appended to an event log or store.

#### Combining CQRS with Event Sourcing

- **Why Combine CQRS with Event Sourcing?**
  - CQRS and Event Sourcing are often used together for scalable, maintainable systems.
  - Commands generate events, which are stored in an event log, facilitating a complete history of state changes.

#### Benefits

- **Advantages of CQRS Event Sourcing**
  - Clear separation of read and write operations leads to simpler codebases.
  - Event-driven architectures are enabled, promoting scalability and responsiveness.
  - Auditing and debugging are facilitated through the event log's historical data.

#### Considerations and Challenges

- **Things to Consider**
  - Careful planning is needed for data consistency, eventual consistency, and concurrency.
  - Additional complexity compared to CRUD-based architectures may arise, especially in managing event streams and ensuring consistency.
